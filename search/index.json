[{"content":"Introduction\rThis blog would introduce some mathemetical tricks on Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs).\nLamperti Transform\rConsider the following standard SDE:\n$$ \\mathrm{d} x_t = f(x_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + L(x_t, t) \\mathrm{d} w_t $$The Lamperti transform is to make the change-of-variable $y_t = h(x_t, t)$ in the SDE s.t. the SDE transforms into\n$$ \\mathrm{d} y_t = g(y_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\mathrm{d} w_t $$That is, the multiplicative noise is transformed into additive noise. Numerically solving an additive-noise SDE is usually easier than solving a general SDE of the form. To illustrate the idea of the Lamperti transform, we can define a transform (change-of-variable) as follows:\n$$ y_t = h(x_t, t) = \\int_{\\xi}^{x_t} \\frac{1}{L(u, t)} \\mathrm{d} u $$where $\\xi$ is an arbitrary point. Applying the Itô\u0026rsquo;s formula on $h(x_t, t)$ gives\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{d} y_t \u0026= \\frac{\\partial h(x_t, t)}{\\partial t} \\mathrm{d} t + \\frac{\\partial h(x_t, t)}{\\partial x_t} \\mathrm{d} x_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 h(x_t, t)}{\\partial x_t^2} (\\mathrm{d} x_t)^2 \\\\ \u0026= \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\xi}^{x_t} \\frac{1}{L(u, t)} \\mathrm{d} u \\right] \\mathrm{d} t + \\frac{1}{L(x_t, t)} \\left[ f(x_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + L(x_t, t) \\mathrm{d} w_t \\right] + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ - \\frac{1}{L^2(x_t, t)} \\frac{\\partial L(x_t, t)}{\\partial x_t} \\right] L^2(x_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t \\\\ \u0026= \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\xi}^{x_t} \\frac{1}{L(u, t)} \\mathrm{d} u + \\frac{f(x_t, t)}{L(x_t, t)} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial L(x_t, t)}{\\partial x_t} \\right) \\mathrm{d} t + \\mathrm{d} w_t \\end{aligned} $$Provided that $x_t = h^{-1} (y_t, t)$ exists, we can express the SDE in termsa of $y_t$ by\n$$ \\begin{gathered} \\mathrm{d} y_t = g(y_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\mathrm{d} w_t \\\\ g(y_t, t) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\xi}^{x_t} \\frac{1}{L(u, t)} \\mathrm{d} u + \\frac{f(x_t, t)}{L(x_t, t)} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial L(x_t, t)}{\\partial x_t} \\right) \\Bigg|_{x_t = h^{-1} (y_t, t)} \\end{gathered} $$More generally the transformation does not have a simple formula, but instead the transformation can only be defined as a solution to a system of partial differential equations (PDEs).\n","date":"2025-12-08T22:49:21+08:00","permalink":"https://example.com/p/study-notes-on-stochastic-differential-equations/","title":"Study Notes on Stochastic Differential Equations"},{"content":"Control theory is a mathematical description of how to act optimally to gain future rewards.\nDeterministic Discrete Time Control\rWe start by discussing the most simple control case, which is the finite horizon discrete time deterministic control problem.\nConsider the control of a discrete time dynamical system:\n$$ x_{t+1} = x_{t} + f(t, x_t, u_t), \\quad t=0,1,\\cdots,T-1 $$where $x_t$ is an $n$-dimensional vector describing the state of the system and $u_t$ is an $m$-dimensional vector that specifies the control or action at time $t$. If we specify $x_0$ at $t = 0$ and we specify a sequence of controls $u_{0:T−1} = u_0, u_1, \\cdots , u_{T−1}$, we can compute future states of the system $x_{1:T}$ recursively.\nDefine the cost function $\\mathcal{C}$ as:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(x_0, u_{0:T-1}) = \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} R (x_t, u_t, t) + \\phi(x_T) $$where $R (t, x_t, u_t)$ is the cost that is associated with taking action $u_t$ at time $t$ in state $x_t$ (trajectory cost), and $\\phi(x_T)$ is the cost associated with ending up in state $x_T$ at time $T$ (terminal cost). The problem of optimal control is to find the sequence $u_{0:T−1}$ that minimizes $\\mathcal{C}(x_0, u_{0:T−1})$:\n$$ \\begin{gathered} \\min_{u_{0:T−1}} \\mathcal{C}(x_0, u_{0:T−1}) \\\\ x_{t+1} = x_{t} + f(x_t, u_t, t), \\ t=0,1,\\cdots,T-1, \\ x_{0} = x_{0} \\end{gathered} $$Now, we introduce the optimal cost to go function $J$:\n$$ J(x_t, t) = \\min_{u_{t:T−1}} \\left( \\sum_{s=t}^{T-1} R (x_s, u_s, s) + \\phi(x_T) \\right) $$which solves the optimal control problem from an intermediate time $t$ until the fixed end time $T$ , starting at an arbitrary location $x_t$. We have\n$$ \\begin{gathered} J(x_0, 0) = \\min_{u_{0:T−1}} \\mathcal{C}(x_0, u_{0:T−1})\\\\ J(x_T, T) = \\phi(x_T) \\end{gathered} $$Consider recursively computing $J(x_t, t)$ as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} J(x_t, t) \u0026= \\min_{u_{t:T−1}} \\left( \\sum_{s=t}^{T-1} R (x_s, u_s, s) + \\phi(x_T) \\right) \\\\ \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left[ R (x_t, u_t, t) + \\min_{u_{t+1:T−1}} \\left( \\sum_{s=t+1}^{T-1} R (x_s, u_s, s) + \\phi(x_T) \\right) \\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left[ R (x_t, u_t, t) + J(x_{t+1}, t+1) \\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left[ R (x_t, u_t, t) + J(x_{t} + f(x_t, u_t, t), t+1) \\right] \\end{aligned} $$Note: the minimization over the whole path $u_{t:T−1}$ has reduced to a sequence of minimizations over $u_t$. This simplification is due to the Markovian nature of the problem: the future depends on the past and vise versa only through the present. The algorithm to compute the optimal control $u_{0:T−1}^{\\ast}$, the optimal trajectory $x_{1:T}^{\\ast}$ and the optimal cost is given by\nInitialize $J(x_T, T) = \\phi(x_T)$ Backwards: For $t=T-1, \\cdots, 1, 0$, and For all $x_t$, compute $$ \\begin{gathered} u^*_t(x_t) = \\arg\\min_u \\{ R(x_t, u, t) + J(t+1, x_t + f(x_t, u, t)) \\} \\\\ J(t, x_t) = R(x_t, u^*_t(x_t), t) + J(t+1, x_t + f(x_t, u^*_t(x_t), t) \\end{gathered} $$ Forwards: For $t=T-1, \\cdots, 1, 0$ compute $$ x^*_{t+1} = x^*_{t} + f(x^*_{t}, u^*_{t}, t), \\quad x^*_0 = x_0 $$This is just like Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm. It is linear in the horizon time $T$ and linear in the size of the state and action spaces.\nDeterministic Continuous Time Control\rNow, consider the optimal control problem in continuous time:\n$$ x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t} = x_{t} + f(x_t, u_t, t)\\mathrm{d}t, \\quad \\mathrm{d}x_t = f(x_t, u_t, t)\\mathrm{d}t $$We have two methods for solving the optimal control problem: 1) Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) (a pair of ordinary differential equations); 2) Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation (a partial differential equation).\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equation\rThe initial state is fixed: $x_0 = x_0$ and the final state is free. The problem is to find a control signal $u_t, 0 \u0026lt; t \u0026lt; T$ , which we denote as $u(0 \\rightarrow T)$, such that minimizing\n$$ C(x_0, u(0 \\rightarrow T)) = \\int_0^T R(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\phi(x_T) $$Then, the cost to go function can be extended into\n$$ J(x_t, t) = \\min_{u_{t \\rightarrow T}} \\left( \\int_{t}^{T} R (x_z, u_z, z) \\mathrm{d} z + \\phi(x_T) \\right) $$Again consider recursively computing $J(x_t, t)$ as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} J(x_t, t) \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\min_{u_{t+\\mathrm{d}t \\rightarrow T}} \\left( \\int_{t+\\mathrm{d} t}^{T} R (x_z, u_z, z) \\mathrm{d} z + \\phi(x_T)\\right) \\right) \\\\ \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + J(x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t}, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\right) \\\\ \u0026\\approx \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + J(x_t, t) + \\partial_t J(x_{t}, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\partial_{x_t}J(x_{t}, t)f(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t \\right) \\end{aligned} $$which implies\n$$ -\\partial_t J(x_{t}, t) = \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) + f(x_t, u_t, t) \\partial_{x_t}J(x_{t}, t) \\right) $$which is a partial differential equation, known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that describes the evolution of $J$ as a function of $x$ and $t$ and must be solved with boundary condition $J(x_T, T) = \\phi(x)$. $\\partial_t$ and $\\partial_x$ denote partial derivatives with respect to $t$ and $x$, respectively.\nThe optimal control $u_t(x_t)$ at the current $x_t$, $t$ is given by\n$$ u_t(x_t) = \\arg \\min_{u} \\left( R(x_t, u, t) + \\partial_{x_t}J(x_{t}, t) f(x_t, u, t) \\right) $$Note: in order to compute the optimal control at the initial state $x_0$ at $t = 0$, one must compute $J(x_t, t)$ for all values of $x_t$ and $t$.\nPontryagin Minimum Principle\rAn alternative approach is a variational method that directly finds the optimal trajectory and optimal control and bypasses the expensive computation of the cost-to-go. We can write the optimal control problem as a constrained optimization problem:\n$$ \\begin{gathered} \\min_{u_t} \\int_0^T R(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\phi(x_T) \\\\ \\text{s.t.} \\ \\mathrm{d} x_t = f(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t, \\ x_0 = x_0 \\end{gathered} $$We can solve the constraint optimization problem by introducing the Lagrange multiplier function $\\lambda_t$ that ensures the ODE constraint for all $t$:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathcal{C} \u0026= \\int_0^T \\left[R(x_t, u_t, t) - \\lambda_t \\left(f(x_t, u_t, t) - \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\right) \\right] \\mathrm{d} t + \\phi(x_T) \\\\ \u0026= \\int_0^T \\left[-H(x_t, u_t, \\lambda_t, t) + \\lambda_t \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\right] \\mathrm{d} t + \\phi(x_T) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$where we defined $H(x_t, u_t, \\lambda_t, t) = -R(x_t, u_t, t) + \\lambda_t f(x_t, u_t, t)$. The solution is found by extremizing $\\mathcal{C}$. We can find the extremal solution if we compute the change $\\delta \\mathcal{C}$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ that results from independent variation of $x_t$, $u_t$, and $\\lambda_t$ at all times $t$ between $0$ and $T$. We denote these variations by $\\delta x_t$, $\\delta u_t$, and $\\delta \\lambda_t$, respectively. We have:\n$$ \\delta \\mathcal{C} = \\int_0^T \\left[-\\partial_{x_t} H \\delta x_t - \\partial_{u_t} H \\delta u_t + \\left(-\\partial_{\\lambda_t} H + \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\right) \\delta \\lambda_t + \\lambda_t \\delta \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\right] \\mathrm{d} t + \\partial_{x_T} \\phi(x_T) \\delta \\phi(x_T) $$Take partial integration:\n$$ \\int_0^T \\lambda_t \\delta \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\mathrm{d} t = \\int_0^T \\lambda_t \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\delta x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\mathrm{d} t = -\\int_0^T \\delta x_t \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\lambda_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \\mathrm{d} t + \\lambda_T \\delta x_T - \\lambda_0 \\delta x_0 $$and $\\delta x_0 = 0$ as $x_0$ is given.\nThe stationary solution $\\delta \\mathcal{C} = 0$ is obtained when the coefficients of the independent variations $\\delta x_t$, $\\delta u_t$, $\\delta \\lambda_t$, and $\\delta x_T$ are zero. Thus,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} 0 \u0026= \\partial_{u_t} H(x_t, u_t, \\lambda_t, t) \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\lambda_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \u0026= - \\partial_{x_t} H(x_t, u_t, \\lambda_t, t) \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \u0026= \\partial_{\\lambda_t} H(x_t, u_t, \\lambda_t, t) \\\\ \\lambda_T \u0026= - \\partial_{x_T} \\phi(x_T) \\end{aligned} $$The first ODE implies the optimal controller $u_t^*(x_t, \\lambda_t, t)$. The remaining ODEs are:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} \\lambda_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \u0026= - \\partial_{x_t} H(x_t, u_t^*, \\lambda_t, t) \\\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{d} x_t}{\\mathrm{d} t} \u0026= \\partial_{\\lambda_t} H(x_t, u_t^*, \\lambda_t, t) \\end{aligned} $$with the boundary conditions $x_0 = x_0$ and $\\lambda_T = - \\partial_{x_T} \\phi(x_T)$. There remains two coupled ODEs that describe the dynamics of $x_t$ and $\\lambda_t$ over time with boundary conditions.\nStochastic Optimal Control\rIn this section, we consider the extension of the continuous control problem to the case that the dynamics is subject to noise and is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE).\nConsider the following controlled SDE:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}x_t = f(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + g_t \\mathrm{d}w_t, $$where $f: \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\times [0, T] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the vector-valued drift function, $g:[0, T] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ signifies the scalar-valued diffusion coefficient and $w_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the standard Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion.\nSince the dynamics is stochastic, it is no longer the case that when $x$ at time $t$ and the full control path $u(t \\rightarrow T)$ are given, we know the future path $x(t \\rightarrow T)$. Therefore, we could only hope to be able to minimize its expectation value over all possible future realizations of the Wiener process:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}(x_0, u(0 \\rightarrow T)) = \\mathbb{E}_{x_0} \\left[ \\int_0^T R(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\phi(x_T) \\right] $$where the subscript $x_0$ on the expectation value is to remind us that the expectation is over all stochastic trajectories that start in $x_0$. The solution of the control problem proceeds very similar as in the deterministic case: the cost to go function can be extended into\n$$ J(x_t, t) = \\min_{u_{t \\rightarrow T}} \\mathbb{E}_{x_t} \\left[ \\int_{t}^{T} R (x_z, u_z, z) \\mathrm{d} z + \\phi(x_T) \\right] $$Again consider recursively computing $J(x_t, t)$ as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} J(x_t, t) \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\mathbb{E}_{x_t} \\left[ R (x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\min_{u_{t+\\mathrm{d}t \\rightarrow T}} \\left( \\int_{t+\\mathrm{d} t}^{T} R (x_z, u_z, z) \\mathrm{d} z + \\phi(x_T)\\right) \\right] \\\\ \u0026= \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t + \\mathbb{E}_{x_t} \\left[ J(x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t}, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\right] \\right) \\end{aligned} $$Again make a Taylor expansion:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mathbb{E}_{x_t} \\left[ J(x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t}, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\right] \u0026= \\int \\mathcal{N}(x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t} \\mid x_t) J(x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t}, t+\\mathrm{d}t) \\mathrm{d} x_{t+\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\ \u0026\\approx J(x_{t}, t) + \\partial_t J(x_{t}, t) \\mathrm{d}t + \\partial_{x_t} J(x_{t}, t) \\langle \\mathrm{d}x_t \\rangle + \\frac{1}{2} \\partial^2_{x_t} J(x_{t}, t) \\langle \\mathrm{d}x_t^2 \\rangle \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$where we have $\\langle \\mathrm{d}x_t \\rangle = f(x_t, u_t, t) \\mathrm{d} t$ and $\\langle \\mathrm{d}x_t^2 \\rangle = g_t \\mathrm{d} t$. Therefore,\n$$ -\\partial_t J(x_t, t) = \\min_{u_{t}} \\left( R (x_t, u_t, t) + f(x_t, u_t, t) \\partial_{x_t}J(x_{t}, t) + \\frac{g_t^2}{2} \\partial^2_{x_t} J(x_{t}, t) \\right) $$We can easily find that when $g_t \\rightarrow 0$, the equation above would degrade to the deterministic one as we discussed in the Section above (Deterministic Continuous Time Control).\n","date":"2025-12-06T00:19:33+08:00","permalink":"https://example.com/p/stochastic-optimal-control/","title":"Stochastic Optimal Control"},{"content":"What is BibTeX and .bib file?\rBibTeX\rBibTeX is a tool and file format for managing and formatting bibliographic references, typically used in conjunction with the LaTeX document typesetting system.\n.bib file\rA .bib file is a plain-text database file where you can store all the bibliographic information for the sources you cite. Its core principle is to separate the content (data) of the bibliographic entries from their display format (style) within the document.\nFor example, each bibliographic entry contains three parts: '\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 @inproceedings{DDPM, title={{D}enoising {D}iffusion {P}robabilistic {M}odels}, author={Ho, Jonathan and Jain, Ajay and Abbeel, Pieter}, journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems}, volume={33}, pages={6840--6851}, year={2020} } Entry Type: Preceded by the @ symbol, indicating the document type, such as @article (journal article), @book (book), @inproceedings (conference paper), etc. Citation Key: Appears in curly braces immediately after the entry type. This is the unique identifier used when referencing the source in your LaTeX document. Here DDPM is the Citation Key. When you want to cite it in a LaTeX document, simply type \\cite{DDPM}. Fields: Contain specific details about the source, such as author, title, year, publisher, etc. Each field follows the format field_name = {content}, with fields separated by commas. How to Use .bib Files in LaTeX?\rA basic workflow is as follows:\nCreate your LaTeX main file (e.g., main.tex). Create your bibliography database file (e.g., references.bib). In the LaTeX file, specify the reference style (.bst file) using the \\bibliographystyle command and designate the .bib file using the \\bibliography command. An example of main.tex is as follows, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} balabalabalabala \\bibliographystyle{plain} % Specify the style, such as plain, unsrt, alpha, etc. \\bibliography{references} % Specify your .bib file (without the .bib extension) \\end{document} What is .bbl file?\rThe .bbl file is the output file generated by BibTeX processing. When you run the bibtex command, it reads your .aux file and .bib files, then generates a formatted bibliography list based on the .bst style file you specified. This formatted list is written into the .bbl file. During the subsequent pdflatex compilation, LaTeX directly inserts the contents from the .bbl file to generate the final bibliography list.\nGenerating .bbl file from .bib file on Overleaf\rWhy?\rWhen submitting paper in arXiv, arXiv requires both the .bbl file and .bib file.\nImplementation Steps\rConstruct the transformation LaTeX code as 1 2 3 4 5 6 \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} \\nocite{*} \\bibliography{references.bib} % name of .bib file \\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran} % .bst style \\end{document} Compile.

破坏成噪声 $x_T$，这里假设需要 $T$ 时间步。把这个过程用数学表示出来（我们约定前向过程用概率分布 $q$ 来表示）：\n$$ x_0 \\sim q_{\\text{data}} \\rightarrow x_1 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I) $$更具体的，DDPMs将其定义为（已知的）前向加噪过程(Forward Process)，他是一个Markov过程：\n$$ q(x_{1:T} \\mid x_0) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} q(x_{t} \\mid x_{t-1}) \\quad \\text{with} \\quad q(x_{t} \\mid x_{t-1}) = \\mathcal{N}(x_{t}; \\sqrt{1-\\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I) $$其中 $\\beta_t$ 也是已知的，预定义好的一个数列，满足 $\\beta_1 \u0026lt; \\beta_2 \u0026lt; \\cdots \u0026lt; \\beta_T$，可以是linear schedule, cosine schedule等等\u0026hellip;\n从转移概率分布 $q(x_{t} \\mid x_{t-1})$ 中可以看出，其实这个概率可以等价成一个等式（重参数化 reparameterization）：\n$$ x_{t} = \\sqrt{1-\\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \\beta_t \\varepsilon_t, \\quad \\varepsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I) $$这个等式相比概率分布而言更直观的体现加噪过程：每次在上一步的状态 $x_{t-1}$ 上，与新引入的一个随机噪声 $\\varepsilon_t$ 进行线性组合，以此得到下一个时刻的状态 $x_{t}$。 现在来看看这个Markov链有什么很好的性质：任何时刻的 $x_t$ 可以由 $x_0$ 和 $\\beta_t$ 表示：\n$$ \\begin{aligned} x_t \u0026= \\sqrt{1-\\beta_t} x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{\\beta_t} \\varepsilon_t \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha_t} \\varepsilon_t \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\alpha_t} (\\sqrt{\\alpha_{t-1}} x_{t-2} + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha_{t-1}} \\epsilon_{t-1}) + \\sqrt{1-\\alpha_t} \\varepsilon_t \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\alpha_t \\alpha_{t-1}} x_{t-2} + \\sqrt{\\alpha_t(1-\\alpha_{t-1}) + 1-\\alpha_t} \\varepsilon_{t-2} \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\alpha_t \\alpha_{t-1}} x_{t-2} + \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha_t\\alpha_{t-1}} \\varepsilon_{t-2} \\\\ \u0026= \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\alpha_t \\alpha_{t-1}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\alpha_1} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\alpha_t\\alpha_{t-1}\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot\\alpha_1} \\varepsilon \\\\ \u0026= \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\varepsilon, \\quad \\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod^t_{i=1} \\alpha_i \\end{aligned} $$这里我们简记 $\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t$，并且对随机噪声的合并中用到了正态分布的性质：$\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma_1^2 I) + \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma_2^2 I) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1+\\mu_2, (\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2)I)$。如果再用概率来表示 $x_t$ 和 $x_0$ 之间的关系 $x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\varepsilon$，也就是下面这个条件概率：\n$$ q(x_t \\mid x_0) = \\mathcal{N} (x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t)I) $$反向过程 Reverse Process\r前向过程的性质就先挖到这里，接下来我们来考虑反向过程(Reverse Process)。约定反向过程中的未知概率分布用 $p$ 来表示（与前向过程已知的分布区分），我们希望能够反转上述（前向）过程，如果可以从 $p(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t)$ 中采样，那么我们就可以在 $T$ 时刻从随机噪声（标准正态分布）中采样一个初始值 $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$，然后一步步去噪来还原，最终得到一个与真实图像分布（近似）一致的 $\\hat{x}_0$。\n但是我们并没有 $p(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t)$ 的具体表达式，所以我们设计神经网络(Neural Network)来学习这个分布。\n定义：$p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1} \\mid x_t) = \\mathcal{N} (x_{t-1}; \\mu_{\\theta}(x_t, t), \\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_t, t)I)$，也即均值和方差分别为 $\\mu_{\\theta}(x_t, t)$ 和 $\\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_t, t)$ 这两个神经网络项。\n我们先考虑如何设计Training Loss：DDPMs选择的是优化负对数似然(negative log-likelihood)，先上结论:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} -\\log p_\\theta(x_0) \u0026 \\leq\\mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T} |x_0)}\\left[-\\log\\frac{p_\\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T}|x_0)}\\right] \\\\ \u0026=

p_{\\theta}(x_{0}|x_{1})}_{L_{0}}\\right]} \\\\ \u0026\\triangleq \\mathcal{L} \\end{aligned} $$接下来一点点来推导：\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\log p_\\theta(x_0) \u0026= \\log \\int p_\\theta(x_{0:T})dx_{1:T} \\\\ \u0026= \\log \\int \\frac{p_\\theta(x_{0:T}) q(x_{1:T} | x_0)}{q(x_{1:T} | x_0)}dx_{1:T} \\\\ \u0026= \\log \\mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T} | x_0)} \\left[\\frac{p_\\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T} | x_0)}\\right] \\\\ \u0026\\ge \\mathbb{E}_{q(x_{1:T} | x_0)} \\left[\\log \\frac{p_\\theta(x_{0:T})}{q(x_{1:T} | x_0)}\\right] \\quad \\text{Jensen's Inequality} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$这就是证据下界ELBO (Evidence Lower

$p_\\theta$ 的建模，通过这个upper bound建立了 $p_\\theta$ 与前向过程已知的分布 $q$ 之间的联系。我们把这个upper bound设为最终的Training loss $\\mathcal{L}$ 。\n可以看到，在推导的时候，我们把拆开的各个部分分别命名为 $L_0$, $L_t$ 和 $L_T$。现在我们对他们进行单独分析：\n第一项 $L_0$ : 这一项在DDPMs的实现中是通过高斯离散编码器(independent discrete decoder)实现的，代码中大概是这样的： 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 # === Log likelihood calculation === def _vb_terms_bpd(self, denoise_fn, x_start, x_t, t, *, clip_denoised: bool, return_pred_xstart: bool): true_mean, _, true_log_variance_clipped = self.q_posterior_mean_variance(x_start=x_start, x_t=x_t, t=t) model_mean, _, model_log_variance, pred_xstart = self.p_mean_variance( denoise_fn, x=x_t, t=t, clip_denoised=clip_denoised, return_pred_xstart=True) kl = normal_kl(true_mean, true_log_variance_clipped, model_mean, model_log_variance) kl = nn.meanflat(kl) / np.log(2.) decoder_nll = -utils.discretized_gaussian_log_likelihood( x_start, means=model_mean, log_scales=0.5 * model_log_variance) assert decoder_nll.shape == x_start.shape decoder_nll = nn.meanflat(decoder_nll) / np.log(2.) # At the first timestep return the decoder NLL, otherwise return KL(q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) || p(x_{t-1}|x_t)) assert kl.shape == decoder_nll.shape == t.shape == [x_start.shape[0]] output = tf.where(tf.equal(t, 0), decoder_nll, kl) return (output, pred_xstart) if return_pred_xstart else output 为什么要这么做呢？从数学上来说，模型经过 $T − 1$ 步去噪后，在最后一步预测的是一个连续的高斯分布 $\\mathcal{N}(x_0;\\mu_\\theta(x_1,1),\\sigma_1^2)$，其均值 $\\mu_\\theta(x_1,1)$ 是一个在 $[−1,1]$ 区间内的连续值（从连续区间内选定的值）。然而，实际的图像空间却是离散的，对于一个连续的概率分布，任何单个离散点的概率都为零，这就会让Loss出现问题。因此，DDPMs设计了这个编码器，把 $p_{\\theta}(x_{0}|x_{1})$ 定义为如下表达式：\n$$ p_\\theta(x_0|x_1)=\\prod_{i=1}^D\\int_{\\delta_-(x_0^i)}^{\\delta_+(x_0^i)}\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu_\\theta^i(x_1,1),\\sigma_1^2)dx $$$$ \\delta_+(x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array} {cc}\\infty \u0026 \\mathrm{if}\\ x=1 \\\\ x+\\frac{1}{255} \u0026 \\mathrm{if} \\ x\u003c1 \\end{array}\\right. $$$$ \\delta_-(x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array} {cc}-\\infty \u0026 \\mathrm{if}\\ x=-1 \\\\ x-\\frac{1}{255} \u0026 \\mathrm{if}\\ x\u003e-1 \\end{array}\\right. $$这里 $D$ 是数据维度，$i$ 是像素点索引。上式的核心思想是：计算模型预测的连续高斯分布落在这个离散值所代表的区间内的概率。具体解析一下的话：\n$\\prod_{i=1}^D$: 假设像素之间互相独立，整张图像的概率是就是每个像素 $i$ 的概率的连乘积。 $\\int_{\\delta_-(x_0^i)}^{\\delta_+(x_0^i)}\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu_\\theta^i(x_1,1),\\sigma_1^2)dx$: 对于第 $i$ 个像素，其真实的离散值是 $x_0^i \\in [-1,1]$。我们通过对模型预测的一维高斯分布 $\\mathcal{N}(x;\\mu_\\theta^i(x_1,1),\\sigma_1^2)$ 在一个小的区间 $[\\delta_-(x_0^i), \\delta_+(x_0^i)]$ 上进行积分，来得到这个离散值的概率。 $\\delta$ 函数定义的区间： 对于中间值（例如，1到254的像素值）：每个离散值代表一个宽度为 $\\frac{2}{255}$ 的区间。例如，对于缩放后的值 $x_0^i$，其区间是 $[x_0^i − \\frac{1}{255}, x_0^i + \\frac{1}{255}]$ 对于边界值 (0或255)： 如果是像素值255（缩放后为1），我们计算高斯分布落在 $[1-\\frac{1}{255}, +\\infty)$ 这个区间的概率。 如果是像素值0（缩放后为-1），我们计算高斯分布落在 $[-\\infty, -1+\\frac{1}{255})$ 这个区间的概率。 这个过程确保了整个连续高斯分布的概率被完整地分配给了256个离散的像素值。\n实际计算中，可以用高斯概率密度函数乘以区间宽度近似这个积分。\n中间的 $T-1$ 项 $L_t$ ($1 \\le t \\le T-1$): 我们先考虑 $q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0})$ 这个概率分布，因为这是一个确定的分布，根据贝叶斯(Bayes)定理和前向过程定义的概率： $$ \\begin{aligned} q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0}) \u0026= \\frac{q(x_{t-1},x_{t},x_{0})}{q(x_{t},x_{0})} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{q(x_{0},x_{t-1}) q(x_{t}|x_{0},x_{t-1})}{q(x_{0})q(x_{0}|x_{t})} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{q(x_{0}) q(x_{t-1}|x_{0}) q(x_{t}|x_{0},x_{t-1})}{q(x_{0})q(x_{t}|x_{0})} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_{0}) q(x_{t}|x_{0},x_{t-1})}{q(x_{t}|x_{0})} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{q(x_{t-1}|x_{0}) q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})}{q(x_{t}|x_{0})} \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{\\mathcal{N} (\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})I)\\cdot\\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{1-\\beta_t} x_{t-1}, \\beta_t I)}{\\mathcal{N} (\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t)I)} \\end{aligned} $$计算这种正态分布乘积除法的混合运算时，已知最后运算结束还是服从正态分布，所以可以直接考虑 $e$ 指数的部分（先省略其他的常数部分 e.g. $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}$），以减轻计算量（这里指数部分展开后的合并化简策略大概是这样的：最终要计算 $q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0})$ ，我们把其中的 $x_{t-1}$ 当成主元（未知数），条件中的 $x_{t}$ 和 $x_{0}$ 作为已知的进行计算）：\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026 \\quad \\frac{\\mathcal{N} (\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}} x_0, (1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})I)\\cdot\\mathcal{N}(\\sqrt{1-\\beta_t}

\\\\ \u0026\\propto \\exp \\left\\{

x_0}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}\\right)^2 \\right\\} \\end{aligned} $$对比正态分布的概率密度表达式就可以得到：\n$$ \\begin{gathered} q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_q, \\Sigma^2_q I), \\\\ \\mu_q = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_t+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}}\\beta_t}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0, \\ \\Sigma^2_q = \\frac{\\beta_t(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}. \\end{gathered} $$先前我们已经求出了 $x_t$ 与 $x_0$ 的关系式，所以这里我们进一步化简 $\\mu_q$\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\mu_q \u0026= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_t+\\frac{\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1}}\\beta_t}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 \\\\ \u0026=

\\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\varepsilon_t \\right) \\end{aligned} $$对于方差 $\\Sigma_q^2$ ，他只与我们预设的超参数 $\\beta_t$ 有关。\n对于两个正态分布的KL散度 (KL Divergence) (assume $d$ is the dimension)：\n$$ D_{\\text{KL}} \\left( \\mathcal{N} (x; \\mu_x, \\Sigma_x) \\parallel \\mathcal{N} (y; \\mu_y, \\Sigma_y) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\log\\frac{|\\Sigma_y|}{|\\Sigma_x|} - d + \\text{tr}(\\Sigma_y^{-1}\\Sigma_x) + (\\mu_y - \\mu_x)^T \\Sigma_y^{-1} (\\mu_y - \\mu_x) \\right] $$于是为了简便计算 $D_{\\text{KL}} \\left( q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0}) || p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t}) \\right)$，DDPMs就直接把 $p_{\\theta}(x_{i-1}|x_{i})$ 的方差 $\\Sigma_{\\theta}(x_t, t)$ 设置成与 $q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0})$ 的方差相同 $\\Sigma^2_{\\theta}(x_t, t) = \\beta_t(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})/(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t)$。\n此时，$L_t$ 就变为\n$$ \\begin{aligned} L_t \u0026= D_{\\text{KL}}(q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0}) \\parallel p_{\\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_{t})) \\\\ \u0026= \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\log\\frac{|\\Sigma_q|}{|\\Sigma_q|} - d + \\text{tr}(\\Sigma_q^{-1}\\Sigma_q) + (\\mu_\\theta - \\mu_q)^T \\Sigma_q^{-1} (\\mu_\\theta - \\mu_q) \\right] \\\\ \u0026=

\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_t^2} \\| \\mu_q(x_t, t) - \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) \\|^2 \\end{aligned} $$这里简记 $\\sigma_t^2 \\triangleq \\frac{\\beta_t(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t}$。这时就能发现，其实最终的loss就是两个均值之间的norm平方。\n再进一步的，我们前面化简过 $\\mu_q$ 了，代入 $L_t$ 中后，\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\| \\mu_q(x_t, t) - \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) \\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_i^2} \\bigg\\| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\varepsilon_t \\right) - \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) \\bigg\\|^2 $$此时神经网络项 $\\mu_\\theta(x_t, t)$ 是需要有 $x_t$ 作为输入的（即我们已知 $x_t$ ），这时候如果我们做一个巧妙的参数化（目的是为了进一步简化这个loss的形式）:\n$$ \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right) $$也就是将参数 $\\theta$ 从均值 $\\mu_\\theta$ 转换到噪声 $\\varepsilon_\\theta$ 上，由此可以消去norm中的 $x_t$ 部分，此时 $L_t$ 进一步化简为：\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_t^2} \\| \\mu_q(x_t, t) - \\mu_\\theta(x_t, t) \\|^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_t^2} \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\| \\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) - \\varepsilon_t \\|^2 $$norm前面的常数倍数其实是可以忽略的（常数倍数对Loss没有影响），所以最终DDPMs就是训练一个噪声神经网络 $\\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)$ （输入是当前时刻 $t$ 和一张带有噪声的图片 $x_t$ ）去拟合当前时刻前向过程引入的噪声。\n最终的Loss $\\mathcal{L}$ 就变成了：\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \\varepsilon} \\left[ \\| \\varepsilon_\\theta(\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\varepsilon, t) - \\varepsilon \\|^2 \\right] $$其中 $t \\sim U(1, T)$。$t=1$ 的情况对应于$L_0$，就是离散解码器的情况，$t\u0026gt;1$ 的情况就是刚刚推导的 $L_t$。正如前面所说的，$L_T$ 与神经网络参数 $\\theta$ 无关，所以就没有出现。\n最后一项 $L_T$：对Training loss $\\mathcal{L}$ 来说是个常数（因为我们已知 $p_\\theta(x_T) = p(x_T)$ 这个反向过程的起始分布就是标准正态分布） 训练算法 Training Algorithm\r用伪代码来总结一下整个的训练流程：\n从数据(Ground Truth)训练集中随机选取一个数据 $x_0$。 从1到 $T$ 中随机选取一个时间步 $t$。 从标准正态分布中随机选取一个噪声 $\\varepsilon$，计算这个时间步下的 $x_t$。 把 $x_t$ 和 $t$ 输入神经网络并返回预测的噪声 $\\varepsilon_\\theta$。 计算Loss $\\mathcal{L}$并对 $\\theta$ 进行梯度下降进行优化，直到收敛。 采样算法 Sampling/Inference Algorithm\r假设我们已经获得了训练好的噪声神经网络 $\\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)$ ，接下来我们来分析采样/推理（sampling/inference）过程。\n这里就比较简单了，因为我们已有 $\\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t)$，所以可以通过我们先前建模的概率分布 $p_\\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ 来进行采样/推理，从随机噪声 $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$ 开始生成一张图像。具体来说：\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \u0026 \\ p_\\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \\mathcal{N} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right), \\frac{\\beta_t(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t} I\\right) \\\\ \\Leftrightarrow \\ \u0026 x_{t-1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha_t}} \\left( x_t - \\frac{1 - \\alpha_t}{\\sqrt{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t}}} \\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t) \\right) + \\frac{\\beta_t(1-\\bar{\\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\varepsilon \\end{aligned} $$所以在有当前时间步下的 $x_t$，就可以根据上述公式往前递推一步。用伪代码来总结一下整个的采样/推理流程：\n从随机噪声中采样 $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$。 从随机噪声中采样 $z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$。当 $t=1$ 也就是采样的最后一步生成 $\\hat{x}_0$ 时，就不需要添加噪声了（这样生成最终的图像时不会引入额外的噪声）。 $t$ 到 $t-1$ 往前更新一步：$x_{t-1} \\leftarrow \\left( x_t, \\varepsilon_\\theta(x_t, t), z \\right)$ 循环 $T$ 步，最终返回生成的 $\\hat{x}_0$。 需要特别注意的细节是，最后一步要区分训练与生成：\n为了计算损失 $L_0$（训练时）：我们使用先前定义的、复杂的积分解码器来计算离散数据的精确对数似然。 为了生成图像（采样时）：我们并不执行前面提到的解码器这个积分过程。我们采用算法的确定性最后一步（上面提到的为了生成最终的图像时不引入额外的噪声），即 $x_0 = \\mu_\\theta(x_1, 1)$。这个结果是一个连续值（在 $[-1, 1]$ 内），我们直接将其缩放回 $[0, 255]$ 并取整，作为最终的生成图像来显示。这样做是为了获得视觉上最清晰、最平滑的图像。 $\\beta_t$ 的选取\r现在我们回过头来看 $\\beta_t$ 应该如何选取：为了尽可能满足最终 $x_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, I)$，我们希望 $\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_T} \\approx 0$。DDPMs原文中选取了总步长 $T=1000$，线性的 $\\beta_t$ (linear schedule)，满足 $\\beta_1 = 10^{-4}$ 和 $\\beta_T = 0.02$ 单调递增，（也就是 $\\beta_t = 10^{-4} + (t-1) \\frac{0.02 - 10^{-4}}{T-1}$），对应的 $\\alpha_t$ 就满足 $\\alpha_1 = 1-10^{-4}$ 和 $\\alpha_T = 1-0.02$ 单调递减（$\\alpha_t = 1 - \\beta_t$）。简单估算一下 $\\bar{\\alpha}_t$:\n$$ \\log \\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log\\alpha_t = \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log(1-\\beta_t) \u003c -\\sum_{t=1}^T \\beta_t = -\\frac{\\beta_1 +\\beta_T}{2} T $$代入 $T=1000$, $\\beta_1 = 10^{-4}$ 和 $\\beta_T = 0.02$，因此，$\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\approx e^{-5}$ 可以近似于 $0$，所以这样的 $\\beta_t$ 是符合标准的。\n代码实现 Code Implementations\remmmm这部分等我什么时候手撕了DDPMs再来更新（恨）\nTo Be

In this article, we’ll demonstrate how to add a year progress (automatically updated every day) to the GitHub profile page—so it looks like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 ⏳ Year progress { █████████████████▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ } 58.11 % --- ⏰ Updated on Fri, 01 Aug 2025 02:10:41 GMT Pre-Conditions\rGitHub Accounts A GitHub Repository with the same name as your GitHub username (see my another blog post Add a Funny Snake Animation to Your GitHub Profile Page for tutorials) Implementation Steps\rWe need to add two files to the repository (we mentioned above): one is the workflows file that implements automatic updating of the year progress bar, and the other is the index.js file that sets the style of the generated year progress bar.\nStep 0: Find GitHub Email Prefix\rBefore implementing the year progress bar, you\u0026rsquo;ll first need to locate your GitHub email prefix - we\u0026rsquo;ll use this in the following steps.\nLog in to your GitHub account. Click on your avatar in the top-right corner → “Settings” → “Emails”. Under “Keep my email addresses private,” locate the noreply email address formatted as [numeric ID]+[username]@users.noreply.github.com. The [numeric ID] (e.g., 12345678) is your GitHub email prefix. After finding the GitHub email prefix, let\u0026rsquo;s start the implementations of year progress bar.\nStep 1: Create Workflows\rFirstly, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the workflows file.\nClick the Add file button in the repository and select Create new file to create a new file. Name the newly created file by entering .github/workflows/main.yml (the file name includes the path where the file is located). Add the following code to the yml file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 name: Progress Bar CI on: workflow_dispatch: schedule: - cron: \u0026#39;0 */6 * * *\u0026#39; jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Use Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v1 with: node-version: \u0026#39;14.x\u0026#39; - name: Update README.md run: node index.js \u0026gt; README.md - name: Commit change \u0026amp; Push run: | git config user.name \u0026#39;github-actions[bot]\u0026#39; git config user.email \u0026#39;YOUR_ID+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\u0026#39; git commit -am \u0026#34;bot: update README.md automatically\u0026#34; git push Replace the GitHub email prefix YOUR_ID in line 24 of the code git config user.email 'YOUR_ID+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com' with your own GitHub email prefix derived in Step 0. Step 2: Create index.js\rSecondly, let\u0026rsquo;s focus on the index.js file.\nCreate another file in the repository named index.js (the same directory as README.md). Add the following code into the file: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 const thisYear = new Date().getFullYear() const startTimeOfThisYear = new Date(`${thisYear}-01-01T00:00:00+00:00`).getTime() const endTimeOfThisYear = new Date(`${thisYear}-12-31T23:59:59+00:00`).getTime() const progressOfThisYear = (Date.now() - startTimeOfThisYear) / (endTimeOfThisYear - startTimeOfThisYear) const progressBarOfThisYear = generateProgressBar() function generateProgressBar() { const progressBarCapacity = 30 const passedProgressBarIndex = parseInt(progressOfThisYear * progressBarCapacity) const progressBar = \u0026#39;█\u0026#39;.repeat(passedProgressBarIndex) + \u0026#39;▁\u0026#39;.repeat(progressBarCapacity - passedProgressBarIndex) return `{ ${progressBar} }` } const readme = `\\ ### Hi there 👋 /* Add something originally in the README.md file. */ ⏳ Year progress ${progressBarOfThisYear} ${(progressOfThisYear * 100).toFixed(2)} % --- ⏰ Updated on ${new Date().toUTCString()} /* Add something originally in the README.md file. */ `; console.log(readme) Please note the line const readme = !

数据库管理系统：是位于用户和操作系统之间的一层数据管理软件。和操作系统一样是计算机的基础软件。主要功能： 数据定义功能 数据组织、存储和管理 数据操纵功能 数据库的事务管理和运行管理 数据库的建立和维护功能 其他功能（通信功能，数据转换功能，互访和互操作功能等） 数据库系统：是由数据库、数据库管理系统（及其应用开发工具）、应用程序和数据库管理员（DBA）组成的存储、管理、处理和维护数据的系统。 数据库的发展阶段\r人工管理阶段：数据不保存、不共享、不具有独立性。\n文件系统阶段：可保存，但共享性差，冗余度大，独立性差。\n数据库管理系统：数据库系统的出现使信息系统从以加工数据的程序为中心转向围绕共享的数据库为中心的新阶段。\n数据的共享性高、冗余度低且易扩充：数据共享可以大大减少数据冗余，节约存储空间。\n数据独立性高：\n物理独立性：是指用户的应用程序与数据库中数据的物理存储是相互独立的。 逻辑独立性：是指用户的应用程序与数据库的逻辑结构是相互独立的。 数据由数据库管理系统统一管理和控制。\n数据模型\r两类数据模型：\n概念模型：也称信息模型，它是按用户观点来对数据和信息建模，主要用于数据库设计。 基本概念：\n实体：客观存在并可相互区别的事物。e.g. 人 属性：实体所具有的某一特性。e.g. 人的鼻子 嘴巴 码：唯一标识实体的属性。e.g. 学号 实体型：用实体名及其属性集合来抽象和刻画同类实体。e.g. 含有鼻子和嘴巴的人 （实体+属性） 实体集：同一类型实体的集合。e.g. 学校 （很多实体型） 概念模型的一种表示方法：实体-联系方法。用E-R图来措述现实世界的概念模型，E-R方法也称为E-R模型。\n逻辑模型和物理模型\n逻辑模型：它是按计算机系统的观点对数据建模，主要用于数据库管理系统的实现。包括： 层次模型 网状模型 关系模型 物理模型：是对数据最底层的抽象，它描述数据在系统内部的表示方法和存取方法，或在磁盘或磁带上的存储方式和存取方法，是面向计算机系统的。 ER图\rER图分为实体、属性和关系三个部分。实体用长方形，属性是椭圆形，关系是菱形。唯一的标识：主键。 联系：\n实体之间的联系通常是指不同实体集之间的联系。实体之间的联系有一对一、一对多和多对多等多种联系。 实体内部的联系通常是指实体各属性之间的联系。 常用的数据模型\r常用的数据模型：层次模型，网状模型，关系模型，面向对象数据模型，对象关系数据模型，半结构化数据模型。\n层次模型：\n有且只有一个结点没有双亲结点，这个结点称为根结点。 根以外的其他结点有且只有一个双亲结点。 网状模型：\n允许一个以上的结点无双亲 一个结点可以有多于一个双亲 关系模型：对应一张表\n元组：表中的一行。 属性：表中的一列。 码：也称码键，表中的某个属性组。 域：是一组具有相同数据类型的值的集合。 分量：元组中的一个属性。 数据库系统的结构\r模式数据库中全体数据的逻辑结构和特征的描述，它仅仅涉及型的描述，不涉及具体的值。其一个具体值称为模式的一个实例。模式是相对稳定的，实例是相对变动的。\n三级模式结构：外模式+模式+内模式\n外模式：也称子模式或用户模式，它是数据库用户（包括应用程序员和最终用户）能够看见和使用的局部数据的逻辑结构和特征的描述，是数据库用户的数据视图，是与某一应用有关的数据的逻辑表示。\n模式：也称为逻辑模式，是数据库中全体数据的逻辑结构和特征的描述，是所有用户的公共数据视图。\n内模式：也称存储模式，一个数据库只有一个内模式。它是数据物理结构和存储方式的描述，是数据在数据库内部的组织方式。\n二级映像： 外模式/模式映像：当模式改变时，由数据库管理员对各个外模式/模式映像作相应改变，可以使外模式保持不变。应用程序不必修改。保证了数据与程序的逻辑独立性。\n模式/内模式映像：当数据库的存储结构改变时，有数据库管理员对模式/内模式映像作相应改变，可以使模式保持不变，从而应用程序也不用改变。保证了数据与程序的物理独立性。\n数据与程序之间的独立性使得数据的定义和描述可以从应用程序中分离出去。另外，由于数据的存取由数据库管理系统管理，从而简化了应用程序的编制，大大减少了应用程序的维护和修改。\n数据库系统的组成\r硬件平台及数据库：足够大内存、磁盘或磁盘阵列等设备，较高的通道能力以提高数据的传送率。\n软件：数据库管理系统，支持数据库管理系统运行的操作系统，具有与数据库接口的高级语言及其编译系统，以数据库管理系统为核心的应用开发工具，为特定应用环境开发的数据库应用系统。\n人员：开发、管理和使用数据库的人员主要包括数据库管理员、系统分析员和数据库设计人员、应用程序员和最终用户。\n数据库管理员职责：\n决定数据库中的信息内容和结构 决定数据库的存储结构和存取策略 定义数据的安全性要求和完整性约束条件 监控数据库的使用和运行 数据库的改进和重组、重构 关系\r可以形象地表示为 R(U, D, DOM, F)\nR:关系名 U:所有属性名 D：属性来自哪些域 DOM：属性和域的映射 F: 属性间的依赖关系 关系语言的分类\r分为关系代数语言，关系演算语言和SQL语言。\n关系代数语言：一种抽象的查询语言，它用对关系的运算来表达查询。\n三大要素：运算对象（关系）、运算符（集合运算符和专门的关系运算符）和运算结果（关系）\nR $\\cap$ S：交 (union)：结果由既属于R又属于S的元组组成。\nR $\\cup$ S：并 (intersection)：结果由属于R和属于S的所有元组组成。\nR $-$ S：差 (difference)：结果由属于R而不属于S的所有元组组成。\nR $\\times$ S：笛卡尔积 (product)：\n将 R 中的每个元组 $t_1$ 和 S 中的每个元组 $t_2$ 配对连接 列数：$n+m$ 前 $n$ 列是关系 R 的一个元组 $t_1$ 后 $m$ 列是关系 S 的一个元组 $t_2$ 行数：$k_1 \\times k_2$ 当 R 和 S 中有重名属性 A 时，则采用 R.A 和 S.A 分别命名对应的属性列 $\\sigma_C$(R)：选择 (selection)：\n用于在关系R中选择满足给定条件的各个元组\nC：选择条件，是一个逻辑表达式\n结果为只包含R中某些元组的新的关系\n一些运算符：\n比较运算符\n$\u0026gt;$：大于 $\\ge$：大于等于 $\u0026lt;$：小于 $\\le$：小于等于 $=$：等于 \u0026lt;\u0026gt;：不等于 逻辑运算符\n$\\neg$：非 $\\wedge$：与 $\\vee$：或 $\\Pi_L$(R)：投影 (projection)\n用于从R中选择出若干属性列组成新的关系(默认去重) L为R中的属性列表 结果为只包含R中某些列的新的关系 结果要去掉重复元组 R $\\Join$ S：连接 (Join)\nA $\\theta$ B： A 和 B：分别为 R 和 S 上度数相等且可比的属性组 $\\theta$：比较运算符 等值连接：$\\theta$ 为 $=$ 的连接运算称为等值连接 从关系 R 与 S 的笛卡尔积中选取A、B属性值相等的那些元组 自然连接是在公共属性（组）上进行的等值连接 两个关系中必须具有公共属性（组） 在结果中把重复的属性列去掉 悬浮元组(Dangling tuple)：两个关系 R 和 S 在做自然连接时，关系 R 中某些元组有可能在 S 中不存在公共属性上值相等的元组，从而造成 R 中这些元组在操作时被舍弃了，这些被舍弃的元组称为悬浮元组。 外连接(Outer Join)：如果把悬浮元组也保存在结果关系中，而在其他属性上填空值(Null)，就叫做外连接。 左外连接(Left Outer Join或Left Join)：只保留左边关系 R 中的悬浮元组 右外连接(Right Outer Join或Right Join)：只保留右边关系 S 中的悬浮元组 R $\\div$ S：保留 R 中满足 S 的，而且 R 中的列去掉 S 的列。 关系的完整性\r实体完整性(Entity Integrity)：主码唯一且非空 参照完整性(Referential Integrity)：外码要么为空，要么对应另一表的主码。 外码：外码是一个关系中的属性。例如，如果关系R1中的属性X是关系R2的主码，那么X就是R1的外码。 用户定义完整性(User-defined Integrity)：是针对特定应用领域定义的数据约束条件。它包括字段的值域、数据类型和有效性规则等。这些约束条件反映了特定应用所涉及的数据必须满足的应用语义要求，例如，一个年龄字段可能被限制只能包含正整数。 SQL\rSQL基本概念\rSQL是Structured Query Language的缩写，意思是结构化查询语言，是一种在数据库管理系统中查询或对数据库里面的数据进行更改的语言。\n常见的数据库管理系统：\n关系型： MySQL , Oracle , PostgreSQL , Mycrosoft SQL Server 非关系型： Redis , MongoDB SQL语言分类\r数据定义语言DDL (Data Ddefinition Language): SQL数据定义语言主要用来定义逻辑结构，包括定义基表，视图和索引。删除表，定义表，修改表。 数据查询语言DQL (Data Query Language): SQL的数据查询语言主要用来对数据库中的各种数据对象进行查询。 数据操纵语言DML (Data Manipulation Language): SQL的数据操纵语言，用于改变数据库中的数据，包括插入，删除，修改 数据控制功能DCL (Data Control Language): SQL的数据控制语言，对表和视图的授权，完整性规则的描述以及事务开始和结束等控制语句。 SQL语言特点\r1.综合统一（独立完成数据库生命周期中的全部活动，包括定义关系模式、录入数据、建立数据库、查询、更新、维护、数据库重构、数据库安全） 2.高度非过程化（用户只需提出\u0026quot;做什么\u0026quot;，而不必指明\u0026quot;怎么做\u0026quot;。） 3.面向集合的操作方式（SQL采用集合操作方式） 4.以同一种语法结构提供两种使用方式（SQL既是自含式语言，又是嵌入式语言。SQL语句能够嵌入到高级语言程序中） 5.语言简洁，易学易用（SQL语言语法简单，接近英语口语，因此容易学习也容易使用。）\n数据类型及含义\rCHAR($n$), CHARACTER($n$)：长度为n的定长字符串 VARCHAR($n$), CHARACTERVARYING($n$)：最大长度为n的变长字符串 CLOB：字符串大对象 BLOB：二进制大对象 INT, INTEGER：长整数（4字节） SMALLINT：短整数（2字节） BIGINT：大整数（8字节） NUMERIC($p,d$)：定点数，由一共 $p$ 位数字（不包括符号、小数点）组成，小数点后面有 $d$ 位数字 （整数位有 $p - d$ 位数字） DECIMAL($p,d$), DEC(p, d)：同NUMERIC （MySQL） REAL：取决于机器精度的单精度浮点数 DOUBLE PRECISION： 取决于机器精度的双精度浮点数 FLOAT($n$)： 可选精度的浮点数，精度至少为n位数字 BOOLEAN：逻辑布尔量 DATE：日期，包含年、月、日，格式为YYYY-MM-DD TIME：时间，包含一日的时、分、秒，格式为HH:MM:SS TIMESTAMP：时间戳类型 INTERVAL：时间间隔类型 模式定义\r1 create SCHEMA \u0026lt;模式名\u0026gt; AUTHORIZATION \u0026lt;模式名\u0026gt; e.g. 为用户 WANG 定义一个 学生-课程 模式 S-T。\n1 create SCHEMA \u0026#34;S-T\u0026#34; AUTHORIZATION WANG; 模式删除\r1 drop SCHEMA 模式名 CASCADE/RESTRICT 删除模式，其中CASCADE和RESTRICT必须二选一\nCASCADE（级联）：删除模式的同时也把该模式的所有数据库对象删除。 RESTRICT（限制）：如果该模式下有下属对象，就拒绝这个删除语句的执行。 表的定义删除修改\r定义\r1 create table 表名 (字段名 类型 字段约束, 字段名 类型 字段约束, 字段名 类型 字段约束); e.g.\n1 create table user (name varchar(20), age int, sex char(1)); 删除\r1 drop table 表名 CASCADE/RESTRICT; CASCADE: 如果表有外键，视图，触发器的话也会强行删除。 RESTRICT: 如果表有外键，视图，触发器的话不会删除。 修改\r1 2 alter table 表名 ADD 新列名 数据类型 [完整性约束]; alter table 表名 ADD [表级完整性约束]; e.g. 向Student表增加\u0026quot;入学时间\u0026quot;列，其数据类型为日期型。\n1 alter table Student ADD S_entrance DATE; e.g. 将Student表中年龄的数据类型由字符型（假设原来的数据类型是字符型）改为整数。\n1 alter table Student ALTER COLUMN Sage INT; 索引的定义删除修改\r数据量大的时候，查询耗时长，定义索引可以有效减少消耗时间，索引可以建立在一列或多列上，索引是独一无二的。\n定义\r1 create UNIQUE/CLUSTER INDEX 索引名 ON 表名(列名，列名，...); UNIQUE: 唯一索引 CLUSTER: 聚簇索引：物理顺序与索引顺序相同 e.g.\n1 create UNIQUE INDEX Stusno ON Student(Sno); 修改\r1 alter INDEX 旧索引名 RENAME TO 新索引名; e.g.\n1 alter INDEX SCno RENAME TO SCSno; 删除\r1 drop INDEX 索引名; e.g.\n1 drop INDEX Stusname; 查询\r查询所有\r1 select * from 表名; 查询部分+起别名\r1 select 列名1 (as) 别名1,列名2 (as) 别名2,... from 表名 (as) 别名; -- as 可以省略 假设起别名的时候别名有空格：select a b c from 表名;\n不符合语法，会编译报错。 解决方案：select a 'b c' from 表名; 或者 select a \u0026quot;b c\u0026quot; from 表名; 查询结果去重\rdistinct关键词\n1 select distinct 列名1 from 表名; 查询结果加条件\r查询符号：\n比较：=, \u0026gt;, \u0026lt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;=, != (\u0026lt;\u0026gt;), not+上述比较运算符 1 2 3 select a from 表名 where b = 1; select a from 表名 where b \u0026lt;\u0026gt; 1; --(select a from 表名 where b != 1;) select a from 表名 where b \u0026lt; 1; 确定范围：BETWEEN a AND b, NOT BETWEEN a AND b. 1 select a from 表名 where b between 1 and 2; 确定集合（不是区间，是列表/集合，相当于多个or连接）：IN, NOT IN 1 - select a from 表名 where b in(1,2); 字符匹配（模糊查询，支持%（匹配任意个字符）和下划线（一个下划线只匹配一个字符）匹配）：LIKE, NOT LIKE 1 2 3 4 5 6 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;%o%\u0026#39; -- a中有o的 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;%M\u0026#39; -- a中以M结尾的 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;K%\u0026#39; -- a中以K开始的 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;_T%\u0026#39; -- a中第二个字母是T的 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;__R%\u0026#39; -- a中第三个字母是R的 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;%\\_%\u0026#39; -- a中有_的 (\\是转义字符) 空值（判断是否为null）：IS NULL, IS NOT NULL 1 select a from 表名 where b is null; 多重条件（逻辑运算）：AND, OR, NOT （优先级 not \u0026gt; and \u0026gt; or） 1 2 select a from 表名 where b \u0026lt; 1 and c = 2; select a from 表名 where b \u0026lt; 1 or c = 2; 排序\r默认升序\n1 select a from 表名 order by c; 降序 1 select a from 表名 order by c desc; 升序 1 select a from 表名 order by c asc; 两个字段排序或者多个字段排序： 1 select a from 表名 order by c asc, d asc; -- c在前起主导，只有c相同时考虑比较d 按照字段的位置进行排序： 1 select a from 表名 order by 2; -- 2表示第二列，按照查询结果的第二列排序 单行处理函数\r特点：一个输入对应一个输出。\nlower 转换小写： 1 select lower(a) from 表名; upper 转换大写： 1 select upper(a) from 表名; substr 取子字符串（起始下标从1开始）： 1 select substr(a,1,3) from 表名; -- substr(被截取的字符串，起始下标，截取长度) e.g. 找a中以字母A开头的： 1 2 select a from 表名 where a like \u0026#39;A%\u0026#39;; select a from 表名 where substr(a,1,1) = \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;; concat 字符串拼接： 1 select concat(a,b) from 表名; length 字符串长度： 1 select length(a) from 表名; trim 去空格： 1 2 select a from 表名 where a = trim(\u0026#39; K\u0026#39;); select a from 表名 where a = \u0026#39;K\u0026#39;; -- same as above 多行处理函数\r特点：多个输入对应一个输出。\ncount 计数： 1 select count(a) from 表名; -- 计算 a 这个字段中不为空的元素总数。 sum 求和： 1 select sum(a) from 表名; avg 平均： 1 select avg(a) from 表名; max 最大值： 1 select max(a) from 表名; min 最小值： 1 select min(a) from 表名; 注意\r分组函数在使用的时候必须先分组，然后才能用。如果没有对数据进行分组，整张表默认为一组。 分组函数自动忽略null，不需要提前对null进行处理 count(*)和count(a)的区别：count(*)是统计表当中的总行数，只要有一行数据就count++，count(a)是统计a字段下不为null的元素总数。 分组函数不能直接使用在where子句中 所有分组函数可以组合起来一起用： 1 select min(a),max(a),count(a) from 表名; 分组查询\r实际应用中可能需要先进行分组，然后对每一组的数据进行操作：\n1 select a from 表名 group by c 分组函数不能直接使用在where子句中：因为分组函数必须先分组再使用，where执行的时候还没有分组，所以where后面不能出现分组函数。\n在一条select语句中，如果有group by语句的话，select后面只能跟参加分组的字段和分组函数。\n两个字段联合分组\re.g. 找出每个部门不同工作岗位的最高薪资：\n1 select department,job,max(sal) from 表名 group by department,job 技巧：把两个字段联合成一个字段看\ne.g. 找出每个部门最高薪资，要求显示最高薪资大于3000：\n1 2 select department,max(sal) from 表名 group by department having max(sal) \u0026gt; 3000 --先分组再筛选 select department,max(sal) from 表名 where sal \u0026gt; 3000 group by department --先筛选再分组 策略：where和having，优先选择where，where完成不了选择having。where完成不了的情况：显示平均薪资大于2500。 单表查询总结\r关键字执行顺序：from → where → group by → having → select → order by 从某张表中查询数据，先经过where条件筛选出有价值的数据，对这些有价值的数据进行分组，分组之后可以使用having继续筛选，select查询出来。

UTF-8\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; charset常用的值有： GB2312、BIG5、GBK和UTF-8，其中UTF-8也被称为万国码，基本包含了全世界所有国家需要用到的字符。\n语义标签：根据标签的语义，在合适的地方给一个最为合理的标签，可以让页面结构更清晰。\n标题标签：HTML提供了6个等级的网页标题：\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;。h是head的缩写，意为头部、标题。\n1 \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;一级标题\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; 作为标题使用，依据重要性递减：一级\u0026gt;二级\u0026gt;\u0026hellip;\n特点：\n加了标题的文字会变的加粗，字号也会依次变大。 一个标题独占一行。 段落标签：在HTML标签中，\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;标签用于定义段落，它可以将整个网页分为若干个段落。p是paragraph的缩写，意为段落。\n1 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;段落\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 特点：\n文本在一个段落中会根据浏览器窗口的大小自动换行。 段落和段落之间保有空隙。 换行标签：在HTML中，一个段落中的文字会从左到右依次排列，直到浏览器窗口的右端，然后才自动换行。如果希望某段文本强制换行显示，就需要使用换行标签\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;。br是break的缩写，意为打断、换行。\n1 \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;aaaa\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;aaaaaaa\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; 特点：\n\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;是个单标签。 \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;标签只是简单地开始新的一行，跟段落不一样段落之间会插入一些垂直的间距。 综合案例：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt;

Take the first $k$ columns to form the matrix $P_{n \\times k}$ Project the original data into the $P$ coordinate system to get the dimensionality reduced data: $Y_{k \\times m} = P_{n \\times k}^T \\times X_{n \\times m}$, which is a linear transformation. The dimension of the data after PCA is changed compared to the origin data. Data Reconstruction\rPCA is lossy, that is, the compressed data does not maintain all the information of the original data, so the compressed data can not be restored back to the original high-dimensional data, but the restored data can be regarded as an approximation of the original data: $X_{n \\times m}^{\u0026rsquo;} = P_{n \\times k} Y_{k \\times m}$\nAutoEncoder\rEncoder\rThe original data $X$ is input, and then compressed according to the network model, the original high dimensional data $X$ is compressed into low dimensional data C, and these low dimensional data is usually customarily referred to as latent vector, the original data after the activation function operation of the nonlinear hidden layer, the original data will be transformed into a low dimensional space, this space is considered to be the high-feature space. After the original data is operated by the activation function of the nonlinear hidden layer, the original data will be transformed to a low-dimensional space, which is considered as the high-feature space. AutoEncoder is a non-linear transformation. The dimension of the data after Encoder is the same as the origin data.\nDecoder\rConvert the original implicit layer data back into the original data space.\nHow to design the network\rFor simple datasets such as MNIST, a network with 1-2 hidden layers is usually sufficient. However, a network with 3 or more hidden layers can capture more complex features, but can also lead to overfitting.\nAs for MNIST, the number of nodes in the hidden layer should decrease layer by layer, usually the number of nodes in the last layer of the encoder, i.e., the dimension of the potential space, can be chosen from 32 to 128.\nCode Example:\rAutoEncoder on MNIST dataset:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 self.encoder = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(28 * 28, 128), nn.ReLU(True), nn.Linear(128, 64), nn.ReLU(True), nn.Linear(64, 32) ) # Design of the network can be changed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 self.decoder = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(32, 64), nn.ReLU(True), nn.Linear(64, 128), nn.ReLU(True), nn.Linear(128, 28 * 28), nn.Tanh() ) # Design of the network can be changed ","date":"2024-07-20T14:13:42+08:00","permalink":"https://example.com/p/pca-and-autoencoder/","title":"PCA and AutoEncoder"},{"content":"Study on Score-Based Generative Modeling\r(●\u0026rsquo;◡\u0026rsquo;●)\nAbout Score-Based Generative Modeling: the following article has given a clear explanation: Diffusion Model: SDE\nA simple conclusion of the Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations: Generalization of discrete models such as DDPM to continuous SDE forms, through predictor-corrector samplers to correct the solution of a numerical SDE solver.\n","date":"2024-07-18T23:45:09+08:00","permalink":"https://example.com/p/2024.07.18/","title":"2024.07.18"},{"content":"Build A Github Repository\rԅ(¯﹃¯ԅ)\nInitialize\rCreate a Github repository and set the repository name.\nLink to Github\rRun the code in order in the PowerShell under the target directory:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 cd dir_name git init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;first commit\u0026#34; git remote add origin https://github.com/.... git push origin main Hugo: Local Preview\rHugo comes with a built-in development server that allows you to preview the site in real time on the server:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 cd D:/html D:/hugo_extended/hugo server Watching for changes in D:\\html\\{archetypes,assets,content,data,i18n,layouts,static,themes} Watching for config changes in D:\\html\\hugo.yaml, D:\\html\\themes\\hugo-theme-stack\\config.yaml Start building sites … hugo v0.143.1-0270364a347b2ece97e0321782b21904db515ecc+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2025-02-04T08:57:38Z VendorInfo=gohugoio | EN -------------------+----- Pages | 48 Paginator pages | 2 Non-page files | 0 Static files | 13 Processed images | 0 Aliases | 16 Cleaned | 0 Built in 409 ms Environment: \u0026#34;development\u0026#34; Serving pages from disk Running in Fast Render Mode.
